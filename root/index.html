        <h1>Quality iOS Application Development</h1>
        <p> Welcome to Ben Staveley-Taylor's web site

        <h2>My Products</h2>
        <p><img src="ScreenLabel@2x.png" class="appicon"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screen-label/id1454415262?ls=1"><b>Screen Label</b></a> is available on the iOS App Store.
        <p>Screen Label lets you add text to your Lock Screen or Home Screen, quickly and simply.
        <p>You might want to show some contact details, then if you lose your phone your chances of getting it back go way up. Or your team name, or project name... anything.</p>
        <p>Import any photo in your camera roll, then style and position your label overlay. This is saved back to the camera roll as a new picture, and then you can use it as Wallpaper.</p>
        <p>You can use a plain background rather than a photo if you prefer.</p>
